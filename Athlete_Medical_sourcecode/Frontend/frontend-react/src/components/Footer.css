/*
This is a CSS code for styling the footer logo animation.
It sets a transition effect on the transform property of the .logoAnimation class for 0.3 seconds.
This means that the change in scale of the element will have a smooth transition over a period of 0.3 seconds.

/*
This code block sets a hover effect on the .logoAnimation class.
It changes the scale of the element to 1.2 times its original size on hover, using the transform property.
This gives the effect of the picture "popping-out" when the user hovers over it.
